# Exercise 11.1.

The team will release an application created with Java. The application will need linting and/or a static code analysis (SCA) tool as part of the CI pipeline. Such a tool could be e.g. CheckStyle, JArchitect, SonarQube, or Parasoft JTest. Testing the application could be done with unit tests being run in the pipeline and creating the relevant code coverage reports based on the test runs. JUnit is the most widely-used alternative for running unit tests, so we would be using that. The pipeline could use one of Clover, JaCoCo, the aforementioned SonarQube or Parasoft JTest suites for code coverage reports. Some of the tools (SonarQube, Parasoft) are full suites covering the whole process of QA and testing, so the same tool could be used for both. However they are commercially licensed, so their usage might not be optimal for our project due to their cost.
Some alternatives for Jenkins or GitHub Actions in our pipeline setup could include Azure DevOps, AWS, GitLab CI/CD, Google Cloud Build or OpenShift Pipeline (the only free alternative of this list).
The question between self-hosted and cloud-based CI pipelines depends on the needs of the application and the team. Cloud-based pipelines are often much easier to set up and maintain, more reliable, flexible and scalable as . Also, if the pipeline is in the same cloud as where the application is hosted (e.g. Azure), the deployment time is significantly shorter as the application does not need to be separately uploade to the cloud.
On-premises pipelines, however, usually need a separate integrator to set up and maintain the pipeline, as it needs much more work in that regard. The pipeline also needs physical hardware to be provided and maintained, which the cloud-based alternatives do not need. The advantages of on-premises solutions are complete control of the builds (e.g. determining required computing power and/or customizing build options leading to faster builds) and the security of the pipeline (as the pipeline is not available on the Internet). On-premises pipelines can often be much cheaper to run and maintain depending on the resources and licenses needed.
